### Brute Force Approach 
  - A brute force algorithm simply enumerates all possible answers to the question and checks them for correctness.
  - It's seldom the most efficient approach, but it can be helpful to consider the time cost of the brute force approach when building an optimized solution. If your solution isn't faster than the brute force approach, it may not be optimal.

### Sorting Approach
  - Sorting a good technique if you cannot solve a problem with one pass through

### Greedy Approach
  - A greedy algorithm iterates through the problem space taking the optimal solution "so far," until it reaches the end.
  - The greedy approach is only optimal if the problem has "optimal substructure," which means stitching together optimal solutions to subproblems yields an optimal solution.

## Dynamic Programming
### Memoization
  - Memoization ensures that a function doesn't run for the same inputs more than once by keeping a record of the resutls for given input (usally in an object)
