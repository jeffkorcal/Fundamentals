### Time Complexity

O(1)        | Constant     | describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(log n)    | Logarithmic  | 
O(n)        | Linear       | describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
O(n log n)  | Lin * Log    | 
O(n^2)      | Quadratic    | describes an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
O(2^n)      | Exponential  | denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.
O(n!)       | Factorial    |
