### Greedy Approach
  - A greedy algorithm iterates through the problem space taking the optimal solution "so far," until it reaches the end.
  - The greedy approach is only optimal if the problem has "optimal substructure," which means stitching together optimal solutions to subproblems yields an optimal solution.
