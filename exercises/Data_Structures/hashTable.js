// Big-O
// Access    | O(1) Constant
// Search    | O(1) Constant
// Insertion | O(1) Constant
// Deletion  | O(1) Constant

// Worse case scenario
// Access may become linear when hashing function is weak and collision are handled poorly
// Only when resizing Search, Insertion, and Deletion become O(n) Linear
