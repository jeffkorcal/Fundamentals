# Async Patterns

### 3 Different Patterns
  - Callbacks
  - Generators
  - Promises

### Callbacks
  - Inversion of Control

### Generators
  - A generator is a new type of function that can be paused during execution and resumed at a later time. The are paused using the yield keyword.

### Promises
  - When a function is called, a promise will let you know when the function completes.
