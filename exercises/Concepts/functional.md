Pure Functions - are function that have no side effects (a function that alters variables outside of its scope is an impure function)

Composition - involves taking the output from one function and directly inputting it into another function

Immutability - refers to a variables ability to be changed.

Closure - is when a function "remembers" the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere.

Recursion - occurs when a function calls itself to perform an operation. A recursive function will continue to call itself until a base case is reached.
