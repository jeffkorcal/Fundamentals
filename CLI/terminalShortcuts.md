# Terminal Shortcuts

Ctrl+U - clear all the current line from the end to the beginning only if the cursor is at the end of the line.
You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.

Ctrl+K - clear all the current line from the beginning to the end only if the cursor is at the beginning of the line.
You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.

Ctrl+W - clear the previous word in the current line. For example if you have typed a command like git diff /path/to/some/file and you want to delete just the last parameter to the command, Ctrl+W is very useful.
You can then recall the cleared data using Ctrl+Y if you need.

Ctrl+E Ctrl+U - move the cursor to the end of the line and clear all the current line from the end to the beginning.
You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.

Ctrl+A Ctrl+K - move the cursor at the beginning of the line and clear all the current line from the beginning to the end.
You can then recall the cleared line with Ctrl+Y if you need.

Ctrl+C - my favourite - cancel the current command line, which implies clear all the current line no matter where the cursor is.
Disadvantage: you can't recall the cleared line anymore.
